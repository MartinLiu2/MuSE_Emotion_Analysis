 Uggh, back in elementary school. The, we had eh umm, like a school carvinal, where there'll be little carnival games set up in different rooms and you can get tickets and, walk around and play the different games. 

And one of the big ones was a cake-walk, and uggh, like, you would, I don't remember how exactly it worked, I think it was kind of like musical chairs. 

Uggh, and you know if you won you got like a cake or something or some other price. You get other prices as well 

and, I remember I was in line, for it, I was super excited to try it. Uggh, 

I wanted to win, win something really bad, 

uggh, and then I was in line with a friend. And then, someone, cut me in line, and I think it was, probably completely accidental. But, uggh I got, really upset cause uggh I w-, it push me just outside the next, uggh batch of people who were going to play the game and, I wasn't with my friend anymore, and I got really upset and started bawling even though it wasn't that big of a deal. 

Uggh, and yeah I cried, for a while, and then, well that was embarassing by itself, and then,

 later on, uggh, my friend would like, bring it up, and "hey remember when that happened?" and, I'd just like deny it ever happened, I didn't want to think about it, I was super embarrased. 

It's cause it was in front of every-everyone, and like, a teacher came over to try and calm me down and, 

yeah that was very embarassing. Ugghm. 

It was a long time ago now though, so, obviously not as big as a deal I know it was elementary school, but still. I. Ugh, that was one of those events where, when I just think of it at night, makes me uncomfortable. That was very embarassing.
