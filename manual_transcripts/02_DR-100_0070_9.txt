 I would want to be, more like. Sociable, or witty, 

like I don't have, like I, I have friends and I've, I have no trouble socializing but uggh. I ugh take a while to open up to people,

 so I think it'll be really great to just be one of those people who can, meet someone new and start joking around with them. And, you know, all, all kinds of stuff like that. 

I haven't, I don't even want to be like super popular, I just want to be able to, be friendly with whoever, uggh cause I have alot of friends like that. So that'd be really nice. 

Uggh  That's something I'm always, self-conscious about, is like I can, joke around with my friends, and I feel like I can be pretty witty, it just takes me, a while before I feel, open enough to do that around people, and it's mostly like a self-conscious thing. 

So that would be really nice to, be able to overcome that, in some way. Umm. 

You know just, from my personal. Experiences and also, you know that's helpful, in the real world, when you're, meeting new people or networking or whatever you know, you want to make a good first impression, so, if I could be. You know very pleasant first impression, that'd be very nice.
 
Umm. Yeah that would like. Some of my friends in highschool. You know they'd just, meet a stranger and start joking around with them and then, that stranger would start hanging around with us, you know like eggh!

 Some, ugh even if for like another city or whatever, you make friends from like Ohio or something and. I like competitions and stuff and, that was alot of fun so,

 being able to start that myself, and having that, self-confidence I guess would be very nice. Ugghm, yeah!
