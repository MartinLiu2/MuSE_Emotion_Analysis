 I think I would just save. Something like. A computer or, T.V or something valuable, 

I don't really have, alot of sentimental attachment to like. Uggh, normal items. Like, emotional value with, items. I'm pretty, minamalistic like that I guess. 

Ugghm. Yeah I'll probably, either my computer, or. My mom's camera epquipment or something like that, uggh just, both for the actual value of the computer and like, the data on them, cause that's I've lost computers before and that's a pain. 

Uggh, although I guess saving pictures would be nice, but I think I have most of the pictures, backed up. 

Umm,  but, yeah that'd be, heh-heh, a scary time having to choose something, on the spot like that. 

Uggh. What else would I save? 

Maybe like, I guess I do have an N64, that my. Uggh, grandpa bought my older brother. 

Uggh, so that's, that's a good memory, that'd be nice to save. But for the sentimental value, and because, I actually enjoy playing it. 

Umm. Should the countdown be, going?


 I know, keep speaking.


 Okay. Sure. Umm,  and then also, also, let's see. Umm!  I guess I do have some pictures, in like boxes somewhere, so maybe I should grab that instead. 

Uggh, yeah, probably just a valuable item I think.
