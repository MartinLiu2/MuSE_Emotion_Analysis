Yeah I think I'd like to be famous eventually to some extent, not like, a celebrity, but I think it'd be really cool to like contribute. To s-society in some way like, with research or something like that, like have some big impact, on either like academia or, industry to be well known in the field atleast. Maybe not be a house hold name, but I think that'd be really good. 

Like. I don't know, there's all kinds of problems in- math and computer science that I find really interesting. 

It'd be, really exciting to solve one of those. 

Alot of times I think about, like, what it'd be like if you just happen to stumble upon an answer. And also like. Working hard (like) ugh, for a long time on something is really rewarding when it pays off so, I'd really love that. 

Umm, like, my dad is very, uggh well known in Michigan in his work. 

Uggh, so I'd love to be in a similar situation with that. Umm. 

I think, if I had to pick something, I want it to be like, some sort of automation. Or a robotics thing, cause that's very interesting and. 

I find like, I like when people ask me about what I'm doing in like, academics or projects and stuff, so I love for people to know about my work and talk about it with them, that'd be really fun. 

Uggh, but at the same time, I wouldn't want to be like, super famous, where I'm. Getting, hounded by people on the streets or something like that.
